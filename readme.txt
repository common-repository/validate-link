A Very simple plugin for editors. It will outline any invalid links upon saving the post.

== Description ==

The idea of this plugin is coming from my work.
I've been assigned a lot tasks for cleaning broken links.
Which is so bored. 
Editors are lack of basic HTML skills, they always tried to insert links like such: 

* href="www.abc.com
* href="awesome-slug

Apprently, they will finally result in 

* http://mydomain.com/current-page/www.abc.com
* http://mydomain.com/current-page/awesome-slug

So this plugin is to display a warning message in WordPress dashboard,
in case there is such invalid URLs in post content.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
